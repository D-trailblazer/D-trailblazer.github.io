The `clamp()` CSS function is a **clever way to set a property with a minimum, preferred, and maximum value**. It’s often used for responsive font sizes, widths, or gaps.

The syntax is:

```css
clamp(MIN, PREFERRED, MAX)
```

Where:

* **`MIN`** → the smallest value the property can shrink to.
* **`PREFERRED`** → the ideal value, usually relative like `vw` (viewport width).
* **`MAX`** → the largest value the property can grow to.

### **Example**

```css
font-size: clamp(16px, 2vw, 24px);
```

* Minimum font size → `16px`
* Preferred font size → `2vw` (2% of the viewport width)
* Maximum font size → `24px`

**Behavior:**

* On very small screens, `2vw` might be smaller than 16px → font-size will **not go below 16px**.
* On very large screens, `2vw` might be bigger than 24px → font-size will **not exceed 24px**.
* In between, it grows/shrinks proportionally with the viewport.

### **Visual Example**

| Viewport Width | `2vw` | Applied `font-size` |
| -------------- | ----- | ------------------- |
| 400px          | 8px   | 16px (min)          |
| 800px          | 16px  | 16px                |
| 1200px         | 24px  | 24px                |
| 1600px         | 32px  | 24px (max)          |

It’s **super useful** for creating responsive designs without using lots of media queries.

If you want, I can explain **why you used `clamp(16px, 1.2vw, 18px)` in your `body`** and how it behaves on different screen sizes. Do you want me to?
